# Windows10-Configs

### For my rice from r/Windowsporn

1. settings.json === VSCode Configuration
1. config.ps1 === usr config file for winfetch. Should be stored in <YourUserName>/.config/winfetch/config.ps1 (at least if it was installed through scoop)
1. winfetch.ps1 === global winfetch config. Store in <YourUserName>/scoop/apps/winfetch/current/winfetch.ps1 (again, if it was installed through scoop at least, for other package managers, please refer to the PM documentation)
